 * `lib/mock/payment-repo.ts`), which already performs the whole atomic
 * operation under `withLock(invoiceId)`: it scopes the invoice lookup to
 * `businessId` (cross-business or missing -> `NOT_FOUND`, matching
 * `invoice-service.ts`'s established convention), recalculates the current
 * balance, rejects `amount > balance` with NO mutation at all (not even a
 * partial one — proven in `payment-service.test.ts` by snapshotting the
 * store before/after), derives `customerId` from the invoice (never from
 * `data` — this function's own parameter type has no `customerId` field at
 * all, so even a forged/force-cast one is structurally impossible to read
 * here), and recomputes/persists the invoice's status via
 * `lib/services/status.ts` before returning.
 *
 * This function only ever forwards `session.businessId` (never a
 * client-supplied id) and the validated `amount`/`paymentDate`/`method`/
 * `notes` fields from `lib/schemas/payment.ts`'s `.strict()` schema.
